# heuristic-algorithms

This is a repository of heuristic algorithms, including particle swarm optimization algorithm, bat algorithm, dragonfly algorithm, genetic algorithm, artificial bee colony algorithm, and so on.

The binary variants of these algorithms are also provided in this repository. S-shaped transfer function (Sigmod function), V-shaped transfer function (arctan function) and angle modulation method are employed in these binary varints.
